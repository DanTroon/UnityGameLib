A script library for Unity game development.


## Installation

Access the UnityGameLib repository.

If your Unity project is a Git repository, add UnityGameLib as a submodule at _Assets/UnityGameLib_.
Otherwise, Clone UnityGameLib into the _Assets/UnityGameLib_ folder.


## Documentation

Documentation markup is provided for all public methods and classes in UnityGameLib.

To generate a local copy of UnityGameLib's API documentation:

1. Clone the UnityGameLib repository into a separate location that is not part of a Unity project.

2. Download and install [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) and make sure it is added to your operating system's PATH.

3. Open a command line in the UnityGameLib directory and run: `doxygen Doxyfile`  
This command will generate a _Documentation_ folder.

To view the documentation, open _/Documentation/html/index.html_ in your web browser.
